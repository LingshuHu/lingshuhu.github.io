  		<p>As a former journalist and editor, I am curious about media’s roles in society, the climate of public opinions, and the inclusiveness of public spheres; as a millennial who grew up in the internet and social media age, I want to know how technologies impact people’s communication and life. Therefore, in my research, I combine two lines of my interests and apply computational methods to examine the media’s roles and public opinions in a computer-mediated communication environment. Specifically, I use R and Python to scrape data from websites or APIs and develop computational algorithms such as machine learning and natural language processing to examine communication patterns and effects in online public spaces. </p>
