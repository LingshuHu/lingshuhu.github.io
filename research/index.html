  		<p>As a former journalist and editor, I am curious about the climate of public opinions, disinformation, and the inclusiveness of public spaces. As a racial minority in the U.S., I am aware of the impact of social and group identities on individuals’ information processing and communication. As a millennial who grew up in the internet and social media age, I want to know how information technologies shape people’s thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, in my research, I combine my interests and develop computational methods to examine the publicness in a computer-mediated communication context. Specifically, I use R and Python to scrape data from websites or APIs and develop computational algorithms such as machine learning and natural language processing to examine communication patterns and effects in online public spaces. I strive for my research to have both theoretical and practical importance via expanding communication theories to a computer-mediated context, examining people’s behaviors in a fine-grained manner within a natural setting, and providing media practitioners and public insights into effectively delivering information and building inclusive media environments.</p>
