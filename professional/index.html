  		<p>My research and teaching are inspired by and built on my four years industry experience as an editor and data journalist. I worked at one of the biggest media corporations, the <em>Guangzhou Daily</em> in China, where I collaborated with Sun Yat-Sen University to study misinformation and had opportunities to closely observe the media ecosystem and to think about how to improve the efficiency of information delivery and promote trustworthy media environments. With firsthand experiences and critical reflections of the media and communication industry, I strive to enlighten media practitioners, via research and teaching, the principles and strategies of communication in the social media age.</p>
