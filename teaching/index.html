  		<p>My teaching philosophy centers on inspiring students to harness technologies and develop into professionals. As a data scientist with a humanities background, I am uniquely situated to translate technical concepts to students of diverse academic backgrounds. As a former editor and journalist, I emphasize in my teaching a learning-by-doing approach. I have three years of teaching experience in the States, including classes on computer-assisted reporting, visual journalism and strategic communication, and multimedia journalism.</p>
