  		<p>My teaching philosophy centers on inspiring students to harness technologies and develop into professionals. As a data scientist with a humanities background, I am able to introduce complex technical concepts in ways that are approachable to students of diverse academic backgrounds. As a former editor and journalist, I emphasize in my teaching a learning-by-doing approach.</p>
